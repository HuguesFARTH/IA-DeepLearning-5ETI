# Practical Work 1 

## Goals
1.  Recalls on numpy, pandas, scikit-learn etc.
2.  Implementation of perceptron in Python
3.  Implementation of Multilayer perceptron in Python
4.  Introduction to Tensorflow 2.0+.

## Exercise 1.1 [★]
Your first exercise consists of downloading the [Python Jupiter notebook](../../fr/TP1/TP1.ipynb) and familiarizing yourself with the different methods of the libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn etc.

## Exercise 1.2 [★★]
Implement perceptron in Python with the following features
1. Configurable activation function
2. Configurable number of inputs 
3. Configurable number of epochs and training rates
4. Make predictions

Test your model with simple functions.


## Exercise 1.3 [★★]
Implement the multi-layer Python perceptron with the following features
1. Configurable activation function
2. Configurable number of inputs 
3. Configurable number of epochs and training rates
4. Make predictions
5. Back-propagation

Test your model with simple functions.

## Exercise 1.4 [★★★]
Create a neural network model using Tensorflow. Your goal is to configure the different parameters of your model and test it with the MNIST handwriting data set.
1. The number of hidden layers
2. The configuration of hidden layers such as the activation function
3. The dropout rate of your model
4. Optimization algorithms
5. Loss functions

Evaluate your model using the different indicators available (accuracy etc.).
